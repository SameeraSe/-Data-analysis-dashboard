# HR Analytics Dashboard — Mini Project using (Power BI)
## Project Objective
Developed an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to analyze key workforce metrics.
The dashboard provides insights into employee demographics, headcount distribution, attrition trends, and HR KPIs such as turnover and retention rates.
This project demonstrates the ability to transform raw HR data into actionable insights through data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive visualizations.

## Tools & Technologies Used
# - Power BI – Dashboard creation & visualization
# - Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation
# - Excel Dataset – Employee Dataset
# - DAX – Measures & calculated field

## 7)Employee Satisfaction Levels
What percentage of employees report high, acceptable, low, or very low satisfaction?
## 8)Salary Distribution by Department
How is the total salary (21.41M) distributed across departments?
## 9)Attrition by Department
Which department has the highest attrition rate (terminated employees)?
## 10)Geographic Distribution
What is the employee headcount across states, and where are the largest clusters located?
## Process
- Verified and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and anomalies.  
- Standardized data types, formats, and values for consistency.  
- Built pivot tables to address the defined business questions (KPIs).  
- Enhanced the dashboard with slicers and charts for better insights.
## Project Insights 
- Workforce Overview: 310 employees, with 34% attrition — a sign of retention challenges.
- Gender Balance: Female workforce (57%) is slightly higher than male (43%).
- Department Focus: Production dominates (208 staff, 67%), while other departments are relatively small.
- Performance & Satisfaction: Majority meet expectations (78%) and ~67% report acceptable to very high satisfaction, but ~10% underperform.

## Conclusion
The dashboard shows a workforce of 310 employees with a 34% attrition rate, signaling retention issues.
Female staff slightly outnumber males, and the Production department dominates (67%).
Most employees meet expectations, but ~10% underperform and satisfaction is mixed.
Recruitment relies heavily on job boards (Indeed & LinkedIn), with limited internal sources.
Overall, the organization is stable but needs better retention, balanced staffing, and engagement improvements.
